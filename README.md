An effort to make open source firmware for burning anything other than Blu-Ray data onto plastic discs with a BD-R drive.

Still TOTALLY NOT REAL YET. Just a pie-in-the-sky reverse engineering effort. When details come along that I can publicize, they'll go here for now. Eventually this repo will become an open source firmware, I hope.
