============
ARM CPU Core
============

Not yet sure what variety of ARM this is. Supports both 32-bit and 16-bit
Thumb instructions. Seems to have some proprietary memory protection features,
and it relies heavily on inter-processor communication with the other cores.


Vector Table
------------

The area from 10000 - 102ff is set aside by the bootloader protocol for
interrupt vectors. It's likely the hardware IVT relocates to 10000 prior to
application entry.

10000: reset
10004: ARM undefined instruction
10008: ARM software interrupt (reflect to boot sector +3C)
1000c: ARM prefetch abort exception
10010: ARM data abort exception 
10014: hardware interrupt? (reflect to boot sector +158)
1001c: fiq fast hardware interrupt
10040: Very complex (IPC?) message handler?
10046: SCSI command handler?
10158: Crash handler?
1019c: Syscall handler? Takes action if R0=1. MMIO~ 4031000-4042000


Cryptography
------------

Annoyingly but not necessarily suprisingly, I'm hitting cryptography already
just in trying to understand the boot process. It's likely someone thought the
firmware should include a chain of trust for something related to video DRM or
possibly protecting intellectual property. It's annoying, and hopefully not
very thorough.

 - Uses 128-bit blocks. It's likely AES, but I don't really know yet

 - A block cipher core lives at [4063000]

 - There also appears to be transparent decryption for code memory. The
   bootloader includes one encrypted region at 000:fff, but the application
   firmware includes many more. Unused areas at the end of these blocks
   exhibit a characteristic repeating 16-byte pattern, which seems like the
   transparent cipher would be using ECB mode. Every individually encrypted
   code block seems to use a different key. The blocks in the main app are
   prefixed with a NOP sled and an MSR instruction which enables supervisor
   mode.

   This hardware probably has a poweron default to be active for memory
   at 000:fff, hence the encrypted IVT in the bootloader.

Memory Mapped I/O

This processor has a substantial zoo of memory mapped peripherals.
Very rough notes, may be wildly wrong.

            - Transparent 128-bit code decryption, possibly AES-ECB mode

            4011064   uint32      Flags
                                      4    Transparent encryption enabled
            4011068   uint32      First address of transparent encryption region
            401106c   uint32      Final address in transparent encryption region

            - Movable memory regions

            These normally live at 000:3ff and 400:fff (over the bootloader encrypted area)
            but during app boot they temporarily move above flash so we can copy the app
            IVT to them transparently.
