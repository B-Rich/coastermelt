============
ARM CPU Core
============

Not yet sure what variety of ARM this is. Supports both 32-bit and 16-bit
Thumb instructions. Seems to have some proprietary memory protection features,
and it relies heavily on inter-processor communication with the other cores.


Vector Table
------------

The area from 10000 - 102ff is set aside by the bootloader protocol for
interrupt vectors. It's likely the hardware IVT relocates to 10000 prior to
application entry.

10000: reset
10004: ARM undefined instruction
10008: ARM software interrupt (reflect to boot sector +3C)
1000c: ARM prefetch abort exception
10010: ARM data abort exception 
10014: hardware interrupt? (reflect to boot sector +158)
1001c: fiq fast hardware interrupt
10040: Very complex (IPC?) message handler?
10046: SCSI command handler?
10158: Crash handler?
1019c: Syscall handler? Takes action if R0=1. MMIO~ 4031000-4042000
