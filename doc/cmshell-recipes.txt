Time
----


ecc println(SysTime::now())

	This is a somewhat roundabout but convenient way to print the time.
	Same formatting used by the default %hook


%%hook -Rc 18ccc
static u32 last = 0;
auto now = SysTime::now();
println(now.difference(last));
last = now;

	Hook the main loop, and print how many ticks has elapsed between
	successive main loop iterations. It's such a tight loop that the
	cost of the division in println_dec() makes a huge difference.


Hook Locations
--------------


hook -Rrcm "Eject button" 18eb4

	This is a call site for the eject button handler in the ARM main loop,
	called as a result of checking button_release_debounce_state (1ffb288).
	With -r (replace) mode, this inhibits the usual button press behaviors and
	lets you hook your own code up to the button, running a friendly main loop
	context.


hook -Rcm "Top of main loop" 18ccc

    The same big main loop, but at the top of every iteration. Put anything
    you want to poll here and it will run in a very tight loop but without
    stalling communications.
