=============
8051 CPU core
=============

The 8051 core implements a USB Mass Storage device normally.

- It has memory mapped I/O in XDATA
- It probably has 8 kB of program memory
- Seems to have direct access to USB hardware


Inter-Processor Communication
-----------------------------

The 8051 and ARM processors communicate via a memory mapped FIFO and/or shared
memory regions.


 Firmware region 0010 - 009c
    This is copied to RAM (just above the stack, at 2000D80) early during boot
    Overlaps with the 8051 interrupt vector table
    0010 begins in a gap between interrupt vectors, includes a lookup table parsed by ARM code

    +20   Address of 8051 firmware memory as mapped into ARM address space.
          Calculated based on address from [4030f5c], but the specifics may depend on hardware version.
